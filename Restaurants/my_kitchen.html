	<h1>Welcome to My Kitchen</h1>

	<p>Not to toot my own horn, but My Kitchen is a nice alternative to eating at <a href="restaurants.html">my favorite restaurants.</a></p>

	<p>When heading out to one of my favorite restaurants isn't feasible, especially one located in a city I don't live in, I like to roll up my sleeves, prepare myself mentally for the mess I will inevitably make and have to clean, and try my hand at creating something edible and maybe even delicious.</p> <p>Below is a list of just a few of the types of foods I like to make.</p>
